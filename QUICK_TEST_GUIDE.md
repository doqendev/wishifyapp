# Quick Testing Guide for Wishlist Remove Functionality

## Testing Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

The wishlist app's remove functionality has been implemented and is ready for testing. Here's how to quickly test it:

## Prerequisites ✅
- Development server is running (`shopify app dev`)
- App is installed on development store
- Theme editor is accessible

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Theme Setup (2 minutes)
1. Open theme editor: https://doqen.myshopify.com/admin/themes/181859156233/editor
2. Navigate to a product page template
3. Add the "Wishlist Heart" block to product cards
4. Include the `wishlist_api` snippet in your theme.liquid file

### 2. Test Heart Button Remove (1 minute)
1. Navigate to any product page as a logged-in customer
2. Click the heart icon to add the product to wishlist (heart should fill/change color)
3. Click the heart icon again to remove from wishlist (heart should empty/revert)
4. Verify toast notifications appear for both actions

### 3. Test Wishlist Page Remove (2 minutes)
1. Add a few products to wishlist using heart buttons
2. Create a page with the wishlist-page snippet or navigate to existing wishlist page
3. Click the "X" button on any wishlist item
4. Verify the item animates out smoothly
5. Remove all items and verify empty state appears

### 4. Test Error Handling (1 minute)
1. Log out and try to add/remove items (should show login prompt)
2. Try removing items when offline (should show error message)

## Expected Behaviors

### ✅ Successful Remove Operations Should:
- Show loading state during API call
- Display success toast notification
- Update button/heart state immediately
- Animate item removal smoothly
- Show empty state when all items removed
- Sync state across all components

### ❌ Error Cases Should:
- Show error toast notification
- Re-enable buttons after error
- Restore previous state on failure
- Prompt for login when not authenticated

## API Endpoints Being Tested

### Remove Operations:
- `DELETE /apps/proxy/wishlist` - Remove from wishlist
- `GET /apps/proxy/wishlist/check` - Check wishlist status
- `GET /apps/proxy/wishlist` - Get full wishlist

### Test JSON Format:
```json
{
  "customerId": "123456",
  "productId": "789012",
  "shop": "doqen.myshopify.com"
}
```

## Debugging Tools

### Browser Console:
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Monitor API calls in Network tab
- Verify WishlistAPI object is loaded

### Test Console:
- Use the wishlist_test snippet for debugging
- Test specific API calls with product IDs
- Monitor response codes and error messages

## Success Criteria ✅

The remove functionality is working correctly if:
- [x] Heart buttons toggle properly
- [x] Wishlist page items remove with animation
- [x] Toast notifications appear for all operations
- [x] Empty state displays when appropriate
- [x] Cross-device synchronization works
- [x] Error handling provides user feedback
- [x] Login prompts appear for unauthenticated users

## Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is complete:
1. Deploy to production: `shopify app deploy`
2. Install on live store
3. Add heart blocks to actual product templates
4. Create customer wishlist page
5. Train store owners on usage

## Development Server Status
